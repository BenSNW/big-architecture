/**
 * String mattern matching using rolling hashing -> MIT 6.006: Introduction to Algorithms
 * 
 * <p>For text of length n and p patterns of combined length m, its average and best case
 * running time is O(n+m) in space O(p), but its worst-case time is O(nm). In contrast, the
 * Ahoâ€“Corasick string matching algorithm has asymptotic worst-time complexity O(n+m) in space O(m).
